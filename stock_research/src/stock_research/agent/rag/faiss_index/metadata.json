Every day we see more and more young people coming to the hospital with preventable heart attack. When we become a health insurance company, we will work very hard to prevent people from falling sick or developing a heart attack, because keeping people out of the hospital is good for a health insurance business. Dear Shareholders, Welcome to a young India with amazing possibilities. I have always believed that we will prove to the world that the wealth of the nation has nothing to do with the quality of healthcare, its citizens will enjoy. Contrary to what you may be thinking, it is not going to take 50 or 100 years. I believe that within the next 7 to 10 years, India will achieve universal health care through health insurance that is affordable. For over 70 years, we have been promised that we can get free universal healthcare with taxpayers\u2019 money. Sadly, this is wishful thinking. We recently analysed developed countries that have successfully implemented free universal healthcare with taxpayers\u2019 money. There are three things these countries have in common. Firstly, all of them are very small countries with population of few lakhs to few million. No large country, including the United States of America, can afford",

No large country, including the United States of America, can afford free healthcare with taxpayers\u2019 money. Secondly, all these countries have a very high tax-to-GDP ratio between 25% to 45%, whereas our tax-to- GDP ratio is about 11.2%. Thirdly, all these countries are already spending between 10% to 18% of GDP on healthcare while our Government spends about 2.1% of GDP on healthcare. But we have an exciting alternative. We are in an enviable position to offer health insurance that is affordable to all citizens. Status of health insurance in India There are three important stakeholders in healthcare delivery: hospitals, health insurance companies, and patients. Unfortunately, hospitals do not trust health insurance companies, health insurance companies do not trust hospitals, patients do not trust both entities, and both entities do not trust patients. In any business, if the most important stakeholders do not trust each other, that business has no future. This has to change. Health insurance companies, hospitals and patients can learn to trust each other if we build a different system. Why your company became a health insurance company?

When I tell the mother of a child with a hole in the heart that the surgery costs 2 or 3 lakh rupees, which she does not have, she breaks down crying. It is the most humiliating experience for any parent to learn the price of their child\u2019s life, and I see this many times a day. After this, she touches my feet and begs me to save her child\u2019s life, saying that she can somehow arrange 1 lakh rupees to save her child. This young mother inspired me to come up with a health insurance in which that 1 lakh rupees can instead pay for many years of premium that can cover the cost of surgeries, including liver, kidney and heart transplants, for her entire family. About 15% of the heart surgeries done in India are done by our group. Every day we see more and more young people coming to the hospital with preventable heart attack.

But when we become a health insurance company and tell the patient to get the heart surgery done, there is no conflict since we are going to pay for the surgery. When the customers and the company\u2019s interests are aligned, magic will happen. This is why we became a health insurance company. Our aim is to offer affordable health insurance for everyone and work very hard to keep our customers fit and healthy and out of the hospital. Why your Company built a hospital operating system? According to the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, India needs to perform about 70 million surgeries a year. Unfortunately, India only does about 30 million surgeries a year. Most of them are non-complex procedures, such as emergency C-section, surgery for a burst appendix, and surgery for an open fracture. About 30% of all diseases require surgical treatment. We believe that affordable insurance will usher in large-scale infrastructure for surgeries, which in turn will take care of the medical treatment for common illnesses at an extremely low cost. To reach the target of 70 million surgeries a year, existing hospitals must double or triple their throughput. A massive increase in throughput cannot happen without a hospital operating system like Athma and Medha AI that we have developed in-house.

Acute shortage of nurses Thanks to our Government\u2019s active intervention in the last 7 years, undergraduate and postgraduate medical seats have virtually doubled. Today, India boasts nearly 110,000 undergraduate seats at 706 medical colleges. Thanks to the National Board of Examination, postgraduate seats have also doubled to train more medical specialists. However, there is still a shortage of trained nurses who are the actual caregivers at the bedside. Patient care is planned by doctors but executed by nurses, which makes them the most important care givers. While the US has 4 to 5 nurses for each doctor, India has just 1.8 nurses for each doctor. This is the root cause of all the quality problems in healthcare. The shortage of nurses in India is due to the shortage of nursing colleges. While there are nearly 110,000 undergraduate seats in medical colleges, there are only 263,000 seats available to train nurses. India requires at least 10 lakh seats to train nurses for our country and the rest of the world.

When they face a shortfall, all the rich countries will poach nurses from India. Instead of complaining about brain drain, we should see it as an opportunity to train huge numbers of doctors, nurses, paramedics and give millions of Indians the opportunity to run hospitals around the world. We produce over 24 million babies a year. Irrespective of our policies, there is no way we can create 24 million new jobs next year. All of us want poor people to become rich and have stable jobs. For you to understand how poor families can become rich in just four years, I will give you an example. There are over 100 nurses, most of whom are trained by us, working in our hospital in the Cayman Islands, which is very close to the USA. Each one of them is remitting home at least H1 lakh a month, and these nurses are only 23 or 25 years old! Our Government must allow any busy hospital with over 100 beds to start a nursing college.

Students from our Udaan program can be motivated to use their medical education in improving health care systems in their villages and small towns. It is hoped that these enabled students would fulfil their dreams of becoming able physicians, have a multiplier effect among students and practice ethical healthcare thereby serving the larger community. The program follows a very careful selection process to ensure we are reaching out to the brightest and most deserving students who have an aptitude and are committed towards taking up science as a subject after class X and choosing the medical profession as their careers. The social and economic background of the students is verified before they become part of our program. This year 435 Students were supported under the Udaan Program for NEET Coaching and 280 MBBS students were selected for scholarship program. The program focuses on providing financial support to these young students for NEET Coaching, mentoring, and preparing them for the Exam.

Our Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) Policy encompasses waste management practices. This policy ensures proper segregation and aggregation of wastes, facilitating the correct collation and disposal of hazardous and biomedical wastes in compliance with applicable regulations. It also promotes minimizing the use of hazardous chemicals whenever possible. E-waste, lead waste, and metal scraps generated at the hospital are collected on-site and disposed of through authorized recyclers and dismantlers. Food waste from hospital wards and the canteen is processed using in-house organic waste composters, with the resulting compost used for hospital landscaping. In facilities without an in-house composter, food waste is handed over to authorized vendors. All types of waste generated in the hospitals are segregated, collected, stored, transported, and disposed of through authorized vendors in accordance with applicable laws. Detailed records of waste generation, treatment, and disposal are maintained daily. Additionally, regular waste audits are conducted to ensure proper segregation at the source, on-site storage, treatment, and disposal of waste.

Measurement of fair values A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A number of the Company\u2019s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. b. Classification and subsequent measurement Financial assets Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: \u2212 \u2212 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 3.13. Leases The Company\u2019s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land & buildings and equipment.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a time in exchange for a consideration. This policy has been applied to contracts existing and entered into on or after April 1, 2019. The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, 176 plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Company\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a",

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right- of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. 3.14. Earnings per share The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.

In all cases, the maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected credit losses, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative, qualitative information and analysis based on the Company\u2019s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward- looking information.

This is generally the case when the Company determines that the trade receivable does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write- off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Company\u2019s procedures for recovery of amounts due. b. Impairment of non-financial assets The Company\u2019s non-financial assets, inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset\u2019s recoverable amount is estimated. For impairment testing, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped together into cash-generating units (CGUs).

Following key assumptions were considered in performing impairment assessment: Key assumptions Annual growth rate Discount rate (H in million) As at 31 March 2023 12.00% 15.55% The values assigned to the key assumptions given in the table above represent management's assessment of future trends and based on historical data from both external and internal sources. Discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the risks specific to a Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The discount rate is estimated based on the capital asset pricing method for the CGU. The cash flow projections included specific estimates developed using internal forecasts. The planning horizon reflects the assumptions for short-to-midterm market developments. The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to materially exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash generating unit. 4 (v) Notes (a) includes land in possession and occupation of the Company to the extent of 9 acre 25 guntas out of total 17 acres 44 guntas in Bangalore allotted by Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board ('KIADB') to the Company on lease cum sale basis for which the Company is yet to execute the sale deed as at 31 March 2024.

Key Audit Matter Auditor\u2019s Response As stated in Note 13, the Group uses a provision matrix to determine the expected credit loss on the portfolio of its trade receivables.

The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables and the rates as per the provision matrix.

Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.

This policy has been applied to contracts existing and entered into on or after April 1, 2019. The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The success of the Sishu Sathi Scheme in West Bengal underscores the scalability of such models and offers a framework for similar initiatives aimed at achieving universal healthcare, as noted in the World Journal for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery. This model\u2019s success in West Bengal highlights its potential for replication and broader impact in achieving universal healthcare, particularly in medium and low- income countries. Sustainable Healthcare Models: Narayana Health\u2019s Collaboration in Assam In 2015, Narayana Health partnered with the Health & Family Welfare Department of Assam to screen children for congenital heart conditions. Initially, children requiring surgery were transported to Narayana\u2019s tertiary care hospital for evaluation and treatment, with Narayana providing logistical support to families. Post-surgery follow-ups were conducted physically or virtually, ensuring continuity of care. Recognizing the need for local access to specialized healthcare, Narayana developed infrastructure and trained a dedicated team in Guwahati. This has reduced the necessity for long-distance travel. Currently, over half of the pediatric cardiac cases are treated at the Guwahati center, with only the most complex cases referred to other facilities. This shift towards localized care exemplifies a sustainable healthcare model, ensuring high-quality treatment while minimizing the burden on families.",

These narratives showcase not just the medical interventions, but the human spirit that drives our mission. Sanjana\u2019s Journey Little Sujoy\u2019s* Journey Brave Kavya* journey Sanjana, born on October 6, 1988, in Purulia, West Bengal, experienced severe heart issues from a young age, including shortness of breath and blue nails. Diagnosed with a hole in her heart at age three, her condition worsened over time. In 1998, during a free heart check-up camp at Narayana Hospital RN Tagore Hospital, Dr. Devi Shetty, recommended immediate open-heart surgery. Dr. Shetty later performed the critical operation, successfully correcting the defect and giving Sanjana a new lease on life. Sanjana pursued her education and inspired by her experience, she joined Narayana Health Kolkata in June 2012, helping cardiac patients coordinate their care.

Instead, they are connected to other veins or directly to the right atrium, causing oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to mix. Sujoy* underwent an emergency TAPVC repair by advanced primary suture less technique and made a steady recovery and was discharged on POD10. Today, he is a lively and healthy boy, attending school and playing with his friends. Kavya, a 3.5-month-old girl, was referred to our hospital with poor feeding and failure to thrive. She was diagnosed with Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery (ALCAPA) and moderate mitral regurgitation. During surgery, her left main coronary artery was repaired, and she came off bypass with stable pressures. After surgery, she had severe left ventricular dysfunction and was shifted to the ICU with an open chest. The chest was closed the next day and was later discharged after two weeks.

Given the complexity of their condition and the critical need for expert care, the Mauritian health department sought assistance from international hospitals. However, due to the high-risk nature and negligible survival chances, many hospitals in Europe and Asia declined the case. Narayana Health City stood up as a Good Samaritan and took up this challenging case owing to their vast experience in handling complex paediatric cases. Upon arrival at Narayana Health City, the twins were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team. The initial diagnosis confirmed severe congenital anomalies, including a shared heart, making traditional surgical options unviable. Given the complexity, the team opted for PDA (Patent Ductus Arteriosus) stenting, an interventional procedure where a stent is placed in the PDA to maintain blood flow from the heart. This was chosen over open surgery due to the conjoined nature of the twins and their fused heart. The intervention was successful, providing stable oxygenation to the babies. Cleanne Papillon was discharged shortly and continues to thrive.

To date, we have performed over 2,100 bone marrow transplants. In 2023, we expanded our Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit at Mazumdar Shaw Medical Center to include 35 state-of-the-art beds and over 150 highly trained nurses. This year alone, we performed over 215 paediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants, achieving outcomes comparable to those in Western countries. This accomplishment positions our center as one of the highest pediatric bone marrow transplant facilities globally for a single year. Under the expert clinical guidance and leadership of Dr. Sunil Bhat and Dr. Sharat Damodar, Narayana Health continues to excel in providing exceptional care. Innovative Techniques and Advanced Infrastructure Cutting-Edge Treatments and Prophylaxis Specialized Transplants for Rare Disorders Narayana Health is a pioneer in stem cell graft manipulation techniques in India.

Additionally, we have implemented CD45 RA depletion techniques, cryopreserving CD45 RO cells in small aliquots to boost immune recovery and combat post- transplant viral activation. In a groundbreaking case, we utilized adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T cells derived from a donor to treat a patient with post- transplant resistant adenoviremia, achieving remarkable results. In 2023, we also introduced the innovative approach of administering post-transplant cyclophosphamide as GVHD prophylaxis in unrelated bone marrow transplants, which has proven to be highly successful. We have performed over 35 bone marrow transplants for children with lysosomal storage disorders, offering them a renewed chance for a better quality of life. Our dedication to using advanced techniques and upholding the highest standards of care has led to exceptional outcomes for our patients.

The only cure was a bone marrow transplant. The diagnosis was a devastating blow to Manashvi\u2019s family. They faced the daunting task of managing a complex medical condition that required frequent hospital visits and constant vigilance. The family desperately sought a permanent solution to offer Manashvi a chance at a normal, healthy life. Learning about the largest pediatric transplant center at Mazumdar Shaw Medical Center in Bangalore, the family turned to Narayana Health for help. Under the guidance of Dr. Sunil Bhat and his dedicated team, the transplant process began. Despite the challenges inherent in such a complex procedure, Manashvi faced each moment with remarkable resilience and optimism.

Simultaneously, the rapid integration of digital technology within the healthcare sector is unlocking novel avenues to enhance patient well-being. These combined factors shape our capacity to create value. Large and Underserved Paediatric Market in India Approximately, 29% of India\u2019s population is below the age of 15, driving the demand for paediatric and maternity healthcare services. According to industry reports, the private paediatric market in India is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% over FY 2020-26. Despite this, the paediatric care sector in India is still in its nascent stages compared to developed nations. For example, the United States has over 200 children\u2019s hospitals, despite having only one-fifth of India\u2019s population. Notably, 97% of paediatric care in the United States is delivered in specialised children\u2019s hospitals, a trend that is now beginning to emerge in India as well. Rising Income Enhancing Healthcare Affordability The upward trend in per capita income in India represents a significant shift in the affordability of healthcare services. Projections indicate that India\u2019s per capita income is set to increase by 70% by FY 2030, reaching around USD 4,000 from the current USD 2,450. This rapid expansion of the middle class, marked by rising income levels, suggests that a larger portion of India\u2019s population will possess the financial capacity to avail",

This rapid expansion of the middle class, marked by rising income levels, suggests that a larger portion of India\u2019s population will possess the financial capacity to avail superior healthcare services. 030 Growing Health Insurance Coverage Medical Tourism Opportunity The penetration of health insurance stands at around 26% as of 2023, more than doubling from 10% in 2019. Additionally, the health insurance market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.55% from 2023 to 2030. As health insurance coverage deepens, more patients are expected to choose high-quality healthcare services. Further, the implementation of Ayushman Bharat, a national public health insurance scheme, aims to significantly reduce out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. This initiative is expanding access to medical treatment, particularly among underserved populations, thereby fuelling the growth of healthcare delivery. India is recognised as one of the most cost-effective destinations for medical treatments globally and was ranked 10th in the Medical Tourism Index (MTI) for 2020-21 out of 46 destinations worldwide by the Medical Tourism Association. The country\u2019s medical tourism sector, currently valued at USD 9 billion, is expected to reach USD 13 billion by 2026, supported by the Indian government\u2019s \u2018Heal in India\u2019 initiative. Additionally, in 2023, the government announced the creation of the Ayush Visa category for foreign nationals to promote travel healthcare in India. In 2024, India is expected to cater to around 7.3 million medical tourists, up from an estimated 6.1 million in 2023. Larger hospitals, particularly those in the NCR, Chennai,",

Urbanisation and Growing Healthcare Awareness Adoption of New Healthcare Technologies India\u2019s urban population is on an upward trajectory, projected to rise from approximately 35% in 2020 to 40% by 2030. This urbanisation often brings increased purchasing power, leading to a greater willingness and ability to invest in enhanced healthcare services. The Indian economy is also witnessing a premiumisation trend, with the rapidly growing segment of middle class households seeking more premium products and services across segments, including healthcare. Alongside urban growth, rising literacy rates and heightened awareness of preventive and curative healthcare are set to fuel the demand for quality healthcare services. The Indian healthcare sector is undergoing a significant transformation through the adoption of cutting-edge technologies such as telemedicine, healthcare chatbots, AI/ML, blockchain, and IoT. These advancements enable personalised and seamless patient services. Healthcare providers are also benefiting from market expansion and enhanced quality of care by integrating these technologies. The telemedicine market in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24% from 2023 to 2030. Additionally, the adoption of healthcare technologies is driving operational efficiency through improved resource planning and streamlined patient record management.

The average revenue per occupied bed (ARPOB) is projected to grow by 8-10% in FY 2023-24, following a 10% increase in FY 2022-23. The healthcare sector is experiencing increasing demand due to various factors, such as demographic changes, a rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and an increased ability to pay for healthcare. As life expectancy rises, more people are reaching the age of 50/60 years and beyond, leading to a greater need for healthcare services. Furthermore, heightened health awareness due to urbanisation, rising income levels, greater health insurance penetration, and various central and state government schemes have boosted the capacity to pay for healthcare. Healthcare service delivery is typically centred in urban areas due to better income levels and a higher availability of doctors and trained medical staff. The urban concentration has resulted in a higher rate of hospitalisation for both in-patient and out-patient treatments in cities compared to rural areas. Such shift is expected to expand the target population for corporate hospitals that operate at the higher end of the pricing scale. Besides the major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and Kolkata, rapid growth in cities such as Bengaluru, Gurugram and Hyderabad have created new healthcare micro-markets.

(vi) Measurement of fair values Accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial liabilities. and non-financial assets and Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair vale measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: - - In the principal market for the asset or liability or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in",

The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. k. Income-tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax: Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously. 222 Deferred tax: Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they",

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. The existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not be available. Therefore, in case of a history of recent losses, the Company recognises a deferred tax asset only to the extent that it has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be realised. Deferred tax assets recognised or unrecognised, are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised/ reduced to the extent that it is probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the",

Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the expense relating to a provision is presented in statement of profit and loss, net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. n. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but not probable obligation, or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or a present obligation whose amount cannot be estimated reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow of resources is remote.

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business including litigation before tax authorities and including matters mentioned above. The uncertainties and possible reimbursements are dependent on the outcome of the different legal processes which have been invoked by the claimants or the Company, as the case may be, and therefore cannot be predicted accurately. The Company engages reputed professional advisors to protect its interests and has been advised that it has strong legal positions against such disputes.

Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group\u2019s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised in Other comprehensive income (OCI).

Leases At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right As a lessee At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. the from The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated the straight-line method using commencement date to the earlier of the end of the",

In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; 297 Corporate OverviewStatutory ReportsFinancial StatementsNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(All amounts are in rupees millions, except",

No interest is charged on the outstanding balance, regardless of the age of the balance. The Group applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss towards expected risk of delays and default in collection. The Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance based on a provision matrix. Management makes specific provision in cases where there are known specific risks of customer default in making the repayments. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward- looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the days the receivables are due and the rates as per the provision matrix. The Group is subject to concentrations of credit risk in its accounts receivable for one customer comprising of 42% (31 March 2023: 26%) of Total Trade Receivables. Although the Group is directly affected by the financial condition of its customer, management does not believe significant credit risks exist at the balance sheet date.

Credit Rating Agencies, CARE Rating Limited (CARE) and ICRA Limited (ICRA) on March 03, 2025, and March 04, 2025, respectively, downgraded the ratings assigned by them for fund-based and non-fund based credit facilities availed by the Company, to \u201cD\u201d as delays in servicing debt obligations. 12. The rationale for the downgrade as per the press release issued by ICRA is extracted below: \u201cThe ratings for the bank facilities of Gensol Engineering Limited (GEL) have been downgraded to [ICRA]D following feedback received by ICRA from the company\u2019s lenders about the ongoing delays in debt servicing. GEL, in its latest public disclosures as well as in its recent communications with ICRA, had highlighted sizeable available liquidity to support its operations during its ongoing growth phase.\u201d 13. ICRA, in its statement also disclosed that \u201ccertain documents shared by GEL with ICRA, on its debt servicing track record, were apparently falsified, which raises concerns on its corporate governance practices, including its liquidity position.\u201d 14. On March 05, 2024, Gensol issued an investor release through the stock exchange platform, signed by its CEO, Anmol Singh Jaggi, wherein the Company categorically denied \u201cany involvement in falsification claims\u201d made by the rating agency. 15.

As per submissions of CRAs, Gensol responded to CRA queries by stating that it was regular in its debt servicing and that the default by BluSmart had no impact on the Company. ___________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 4 of 29 17. The CRAs further submitted that when they sought term loan statements, Gensol provided the statements of all lenders except those of Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC). In respect of these two lenders (PFC and IREDA), Gensol shared Conduct Letters purportedly issued by IREDA and PFC, which stated that Gensol was regular in its debt servicing. 18. CARE also submitted that Gensol requested withdrawal of the ratings assigned to it and, in support of this request, submitted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) purportedly issued by its (Gensol) lenders. 19. However, upon seeking confirmation from IREDA and PFC regarding the issuance of the Conduct Letters and NOCs, both the lenders categorically denied having issued such letters.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has passed since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financing. 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29.

Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the same letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a payable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. 57. From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs.",

Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do.

Need for Interim Directions 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- ___________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 27 of 29 intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91.

In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At this stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the investors. 94. In view of the above, pending detailed investigation, I deem it fit to issue immediate interim directions to safeguard the interests of the investors and preserve market integrity. 95. At the same time, I deem it",
